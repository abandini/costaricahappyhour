                    <h3>Guaro - The National Spirit of Costa Rica</h3>
                    <p><strong>Guaro</strong> is Costa Rica's most beloved liquor - a clear spirit distilled from sugarcane. While it's similar to vodka in appearance, guaro has a naturally sweeter taste and lower alcohol content, making it incredibly versatile in cocktails.</p>

                    <p>The official brand is <strong>Cacique</strong>, produced by the government-controlled Fábrica Nacional de Licores (FANAL). Don't let its affordable price fool you - Cacique is a quality spirit that forms the base of Costa Rica's most famous cocktails.</p>

                    <h3>Traditional Costa Rican Beers</h3>
                    <p><strong>Imperial</strong> (since 1924) is the undisputed king of Costa Rican beers. Recognizable by its black eagle logo, this light golden lager at 4.6% ABV is perfectly suited for the tropical climate - refreshing, crisp, and easy to drink all day.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pilsen</strong> (since 1888) is actually older than Imperial and remains the second most popular choice. At 5.1% ABV, it's slightly stronger with a distinctive red and white label.</p>

                    <p><strong>Bavaria</strong> rounds out the traditional trio, brewed by Cervecería Costa Rica (the same company behind Imperial and Pilsen).</p>

                    <h3>The Craft Beer Revolution</h3>
                    <p>Costa Rica's craft beer scene has exploded in recent years, led by pioneers like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Costa Rica Craft Brewing</strong> - The trailblazers who launched Libertas (tropical golden ale) and Segua (red ale) in 2010</li>
                        <li><strong>Monteverde Brewing Co</strong> - Uses mineral-rich local waters to create unique mountain brews like Sirena Dorada golden ale</li>
                        <li><strong>San Roque Brewery</strong> - Family-owned underdog offering Matabuey IPA, Terciopelo Golden Ale, and Toboba Coffee Porter</li>
                        <li><strong>Volcano Brewing Company</strong> - Tamarindo's beachfront brewery at Witch's Rock Surf Camp</li>
                        <li><strong>PuddleFish Brewery</strong> - Jaco's craft destination with fish tacos to match</li>
                        <li><strong>Luke's Taproom</strong> - Puerto Viejo's Caribbean craft spot with honey mango ale and chocolate porter</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Local brewers often incorporate native ingredients like mango, coconut, pineapple, and cocoa to create beers that capture the essence of Costa Rica.</p>

                    <h3>Signature Costa Rican Cocktails</h3>

                    <h4>Chiliguaro</h4>
                    <p>Born in the bars of <strong>Playas del Coco</strong>, this spicy shot has become a Costa Rican institution. Mix guaro with hot sauce, fresh lime juice, and a pinch of salt. It's like a spicy Bloody Mary in shot form - the perfect way to start a night out.</p>

                    <h4>Guaro Sour</h4>
                    <p>The classic Costa Rican cocktail. Combine guaro with fresh lime juice, sugar, and club soda for a refreshing tropical twist on the whiskey sour.</p>

                    <h4>Michelada</h4>
                    <p>A spicy beer cocktail perfect for hot beach days. Mix Imperial or Pilsen with lime juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and salt. Served in a salt-rimmed glass, it's Costa Rica's ultimate hangover cure.</p>

                    <h4>Coco Loco</h4>
                    <p>Found throughout the Caribbean coast, especially in <strong>Puerto Viejo</strong>. Fresh coconut water mixed with rum and fruit juice, served right in the coconut shell.</p>

                    <h4>Costa Rican Mule</h4>
                    <p>A local twist on the Moscow Mule - Imperial beer mixed with lime juice and ginger beer.</p>

                    <h4>Miguelito</h4>
                    <p>A sweet shot made with guaro, coconut water, and evaporated milk - tropical and smooth.</p>

                    <h3>Holiday Drinks</h3>
                    <p><strong>Rompope</strong> is Costa Rica's version of eggnog, traditionally enjoyed during Christmas and Independence Day. Made with rum, milk, eggs, sugar, and warming spices, it's a creamy indulgence that brings families together.</p>
